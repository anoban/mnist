    Rectified Linear Unit: x if x > 0 else 0

    `Parameters`:
    data: NDArray[np.float64] - a matrix of image pixels (normalized, values in the of 0 and 1, in the first iteration)
    that are tobe updated in subsequent iterations. (could breach the above specified range!)

    `Returns`:
    NDArray[np.float64] - ReLUed pixel values.

    `Notes`:
    np.maximum returns the elementwise maxima of two arrays.
    If one input is a scalar, then the scalar gets broadcasted to the shape of the array, followed by the determination of elementwise maxima.
    So, this implementation scans through the array, and if the element is greater than or equal to 0, it takes that value else uses 0 to fillers.
    Implemented as a simple wrapper around np.maximum with a default value.

    """
    Softmax(x) : e is exponentiated to the elements of column vector (x), followed by an element-wise division by the sum of exponentiated
    values.

    `Parameters`:
    data: NDArray[np.float64] - image pixel matrix

    `Returns`:
    NDArray[np.float64] - appropriateness probabilities for each label, for each image in the data matrix

    `Notes`:
    Video by Samson Zhang uses .sum() to divide by the total sum, but division by column sums is more appropriate here,
    as we do not need to normalize globally, we just need normalize the exponentiation results for each column (image), so we get a
    valid set of probabilities for each label for each image!

    `Returns`:
    NDArray[np.float64] - one hot encoded labels (composed of binary flags)
    e.g. a class label 4, where the possible labels are 0 to 5 will produce an array => [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    where only the fifth flag (corresponding to the value 4) is `turned on`.

    `Notes`:
    Returned array will be of the shape (labels.max() - labels.min() + 1) x labels.size, where each label will be one-hot
    encoded as separate columns. Labels are assumed to comprise only of non-negative 64 bit floats, with minimum always
    at 0.0 (the range is assumed to be 0 to labels.max()).

    `Returns`:

    `Notes`:
    Considering the ReLU's derivative function, slope is 0 (m = 0) as long as x <= 0
    Slope becomes 1 (m = 1) where x > 0
    If the ReLU result is 0, the original input must have been a negative value, which will give us a slope of 0.
    If the ReLU result is greater than 0, then the original input must have been greater than 0, which will give us a slope of 1.
    Using fastmath as the only possible results are 0s and 1s, accuracy doesn't matter much here.
